Multithreading in Java (Simple Explanation)
Multithreading is a feature in Java that allows a program to execute multiple tasks at the same time by running them in separate threads.

A thread is like a lightweight process that runs independently but shares the same memory space. In Java, multithreading helps in improving performance and efficiency.

Real-Life Example: Multithreading in a Coffee Shop
Imagine a coffee shop where:

A barista (thread 1) prepares coffee.
A cashier (thread 2) takes orders.
A cleaner (thread 3) cleans tables.
All these tasks happen simultaneously to improve efficiency. If only one person did all the work one by one, customers would have to wait much longer.

Similarly, in Java, we use multiple threads to handle different tasks at the same time.



Key Benefits of Multithreading:
✅ Faster Execution – Tasks run in parallel.
✅ Better Resource Utilization – Uses CPU more efficiently.
✅ Improves Responsiveness – Useful for apps like games, servers, and UI applications.
