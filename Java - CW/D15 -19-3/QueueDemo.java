/*4. Queue Interface (FIFO - First In, First Out)
A Queue follows the FIFO principle, meaning elements are processed in the order they arrive.

Implementations:
LinkedList â†’ Can function as both List and Queue.
PriorityQueue â†’ Orders elements based on priority.
ðŸ’¡ Real-Life Example:
A customer service call center, where calls are answered in the order they arrive.



ðŸ›  Use Case: When processing tasks in order of arrival.
